    <p>In West Africa, newborns are given special names depending on the day they are born. Diverse ethnicities have variants and meanings as a symbol of cultural integrity and ancestral affiliation. Hereâ€™s your need-to-know guide. </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p> The naming system of the Akan people is as distinct as that which elders in Togo (the Ewe people), the Ga people, Benin (the Fon people), and the African diaspora pass on to toddlers. Other forms of traditional naming include middle names, which can refer to order of birth as part of the caste of siblings, twin status, or could be an inherited maiden name. Aside the fact that day names are a simple means for commonality, they are easy conversation starters and icebreakers.</p>
